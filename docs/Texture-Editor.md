# Texture Editor

Texture editor is responsible for providing the user with a simple way to 
draw a skin for created model. You can always use other external program to 
draw the skin for your model. This texture editor isn't suppose to turn out 
like Photoshop with tons of plugins and tools.

## Capabilities (for starter)

* Drawing and erasing pixels
* Filling (omg recursive filling, oh boy)
* Moving and zooming canvas

## Description

Tool bar buttons:

* Pencil tool
* Eraser tool
* Picker tool
* Bucket tool
* Two color picker

Other part of the screen is filled with texture editor (something like Pixen's main 
editing screen). Basically the texture editor is really similar to Pixen.

Texture editor supports multiple color selection, bucket, and stuff.
