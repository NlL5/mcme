Texture editor is responsible for providing the user with a simple way to 
draw a skin for created model. You can always use other external program to 
draw the skin for your model.

* Drawing and erasing pixels
* Filling (omg recursive filling, oh boy)
* Moving and zooming canvas

## Description

Tool bar buttons:

* Pencil tool
* Eraser tool
* Picker tool

Other part of the screen is filled with texture editor (something like Pixen's main 
editing screen). Basically the texture editor is really similar to Pixen.
