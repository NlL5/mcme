## McME â€“ Minecraft Model Editor

**Attention**: it's only for [Blockbuster mod](http://github.com/mchorse/blockbuster) (yet).

McME is a simple web based application which allow creating and editing JSON 
models for Blockbuster mod.

Based on my [prototype](https://gist.github.com/mchorse/b567a0fbd0f9b8f80ed480c36cfea22b). 
Check out [docs](https://github.com/mchorse/mcme/tree/master/docs) folder for more 
information about this awesome project.

By the way, this editor could be used as skin editor.

    It would be cool if Mojang would integrate my implementation of JSON entity 
    models into Minecraft *giggles* 

    Lots of people may start hating me :D
